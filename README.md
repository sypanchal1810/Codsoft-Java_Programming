# Java Programming Internship at Codsoft

July 2023 Batch - Java Programming Internship at Codsoft! Below is a summary of
the five tasks I have successfully accomplished during the internship.

## Task 1: Guess The Number Game

This is a simple Java command-line application that allows users to play a
number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100,
and the user needs to guess that number within a limited number of attempts.

## Task 2: Word Counter

This is a simple Java program that allows users to input a text or provide a
path to a `.txt` file and then counts the number of words in the text.
Additionally, it provides statistics such as the number of unique words and the
frequency of each word in the text.

## Task 3: Student Management System

This project is a simple console-based Student Management System implemented in
Java. It allows users to perform various operations like adding a new student,
updating student information, searching for a student, displaying all students,
and removing a student. The student data is stored in a MySQL database using
JDBC.

## Task 4: ATM Machine Interface

This project is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface implemented in
Java. It allows users to interact with a virtual ATM to perform basic banking
operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account
balance.

## Task 5: Address Book System

This is a simple Java console-based application for managing an Address Book
System. It allows users to interact with the system by performing various
operations such as adding new contacts, editing existing contact information,
searching for contacts, displaying all contacts, and exiting the application.
The contact data is stored in a MySQL database.
